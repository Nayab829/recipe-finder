# 🥘 Recipe Finder – Case Study

## 🔍 Project Overview
**Recipe Finder** is a full-stack web application that allows users to search recipes by name, view detailed cooking instructions, and save their favorite meals. The goal of this project was to strengthen my frontend and backend skills by working with real APIs, connecting to a database, and building a complete application workflow.

This project was part of my **1-month self-led internship**, where I worked daily on planning, developing, and deploying a real-world web app.

## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions

### 🌀 Duplicate API Calls & Modals
I faced issues with multiple API calls and duplicated modals when clicking recipe cards. I learned to use `data-id` attributes and event delegation to manage clicks efficiently and avoid duplicated elements.

### 🔁 Connecting Frontend to Backend
It was my first time setting up a real backend with MongoDB. I built REST APIs using Express, tested with Postman, and used `fetch` to send requests from the frontend. Learned to handle CORS, routes, and server deployment.

### ♻️ Refactoring JavaScript
I modularized my JS code to keep it maintainable, reusable, and clean. This included separating logic for fetching, UI rendering, and utilities.
